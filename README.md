Certainly! Here's a simplified README for your C# test application:

# Simple Test Generator

## Overview

Simple Test Generator is a basic application developed for a university project. It is a straightforward and quickly implemented tool designed to assist in generating and managing tests. The application is written in C# using Visual Studio and features a simple user interface.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an easy-to-use interface for generating and managing tests.

- **No Database Dependency:** Simple Test Generator operates without a database. It utilizes arrays of "question" objects to store test data, eliminating the need for a database setup.

- **Customizable Tests:** Users can easily modify the test content by adjusting the arrays of "question" objects directly in the code.

## Usage

### Changing Test Content

To modify the test content, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Locate the `ChooserFrame.cs` file.
3. Find the `listBox1.Items.Add(` section in the code.
4. Update the test content by adding or modifying the `Question` objects. For example, in `ControlTest.cs`:

```csharp
case 1:
    return new Question[]
    {
        new Question("What is the capital of France?", new string[] { "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome" }, 0),
        // Add more questions as needed
    };
```

5. Save the changes.

### Running the Application

Build and run the application in Visual Studio to use the updated test content.

## Note

This application was developed for educational purposes, and its simplicity is intentional. It does not rely on a database to store test data for reasons such as the nature of the original test material, time constraints, and security considerations to prevent unauthorized access to test content.
